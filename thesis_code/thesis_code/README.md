This repository contains the code and data for my Master's thesis entitled "What happens when we break the system? The impact of disrupting form-to-meaning structure in lexical processing".

The code is presented in three Jupyter notebooks, following the structure of the research pipeline:
- DataPreparation.ipynb
- ModelTraining.ipynb
- Evaluation.ipynb

The required input data are provide in the input folder, whereas the data frames created are in the data folder.
